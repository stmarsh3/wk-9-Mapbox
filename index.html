        <h3>Mineral Extraction</h3>
        <p>
            One of the main systems of the Laptop starts with the Liquid Crystal display.
            Also known as the LCD, this system of the laptop is born from materials
            found in the natural environment.  The journey starts with the extraction of
            a wide variety of minerals such as; Quarts, Galena, Pyromorphite, Cerussite,
            Anglesite, Hematite, Cassiterite, and Sphalerite.  These can be found in
            the mountians of Yaogangxiazhen.
        </p>

    <section id="lc">
        <h3>Liquid Crystals</h3>
        <p>
            Leaving our journey in the mountian to a more broad spectrum, we take
            a look into the primary function of the LCD.  Liquid Crystals are an
            organic set of rod shaped molecules that make up the middle of
            every laptop, phone, and t.v. screens.  Liquid Crystals are abundant
            in any living systems with protein and cell membranes.  A few main
            systems of extraction are from plants, beetle shells, and human bone.
        </p>

    <section id="production1">
        <h3>Xiamen Precise Display Co.</h3>
        <p>
            Along the journey of the LCD production, there are many manufacturing
            companies primarily located in China and Taiwan.  This stage of the
            manufacturing process is where the Minerals and Liquid Crystals move
            into creation of the screen.  The process follows a twenty step method
            which creates the screen we all stare at daily.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="production2">
        <h3>Taiwan Screen Optronics Co.</h3>
        <p>
            Another company of the manufacturing process where Minerals and Liquid
            Crystals are turned into multiple LCD screens.  Companies use one large
            sheet of glass, which in turn will make eight individual screens.  There
            are many different styles of glass manufactured for a range of purposes.
            Gaming LCD screens are made to withstand a higher definition display, where
            some screens are of lower quality and can not handle the power of certain
            programs.  After the screens are complete and put into their casing, the screens
            are then packed for shipping.
        </p>

    <section id="production3">
        <h3>Micro-Star International Co.</h3>
        <p>
            Along the next stage of the production line is the combination of
            the separate laptop pieces.  For each piece of the laptop, there is a
            separate path of life that is followed to the final production site.
            After the LCD is delivered to the manufacturing company, someone takes
            the separte pieces and connectecs the LCD to the motherboard.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="production4">
        <h3>Microsoft Taiwan</h3>
        <p>
            Similar to the manufacturing process of the LCD, the laptop has multiple
            manufacturing sites.  There are many laptop companies that complete the
            manufacturing process.  Some are more well known such as Apple and Acer,
            where some are lesser known such as MSI and Razer.  Though all are different
            companies, they all produce the same product but with different specs.
            The next step of the journey is where the laptop is packages and shipped
            to the millions of retail stores across the planet.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="distribution1">
        <h3>BestBuy</h3>
        <p>
            The final stop of the manufacturing and production of the laptop is
            located generally at major retailers such as BestBuy.  Electronic stores
            are the primary locations of distribution to the commercial industry for
            personal consumption.  Other locations such as Walmart or Target are also
            distributors of laptops.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="distribution2">
        <h3>Apple / Asus</h3>
        <p>
            Another source of distribution are chain stores such as Apple.  This
            is another method of distribution for companies to sell goods under their
            brand name.  Asus is another example of a company in which you can buy
            many items from the brand.  Now the journey of the manufacturing process
            to commercial distribution has come to an end.  Although there is one more
            stop along this life cycle.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="distribution3">
        <h3>Public Consumption</h3>
        <p>
            The final stop along this journey is the public consumption.  Where
            does the laptop end up?  Following the commercial distribution, people
            across the globe take these laptops home for personal use.  Another stop
            for the laptop may even be in Hayes Hall during studio.
